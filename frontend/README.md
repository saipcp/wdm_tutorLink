## 🚀 Deployment

## ✅ Bugfix: Access token persisted on login

If you saw 401s like "Access token required" when calling admin endpoints from the UI, it's usually because the frontend wasn't persisting the token returned at login. The Auth flow now saves the token returned by `/auth/login` into localStorage under the key `tutorlink_user`.

How to verify locally:

1. Start the backend + frontend dev servers.
2. Log in using the admin demo account: `admin@tutorlink.com / password`.
3. Open browser DevTools -> Application -> Local Storage -> `tutorlink_user` and confirm the stored object contains a `token` field.
4. In Network tab, perform an admin action like creating a user from the Admin Dashboard. Confirm the request to `/api/v1/admin/users` includes the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header and returns 200/201 instead of 401.

If the token is missing, re-login (or clear `tutorlink_user`) and try again.

## ✅ Bugfix: Admin - Add Subject behavior

Fixed two issues in the Admin UI:

- Subjects form would close without submitting — now it actually calls the API and only closes on success.
- Topics input previously split only on commas and had awkward default values — topics now accept comma, semicolon or newline separators and preserve spaces inside topic names.

How to verify:

1. Log in as an admin (demo: `admin@tutorlink.com / password`).
2. From the Admin Dashboard or Admin Subjects page, click Add Subject.
3. Try entering topics using commas, semicolons, or newlines, and include spaces inside topic names (e.g. `Algebra I, Linear algebra; Calculus\nAdvanced topics`).
4. Click Add Subject — the modal should stay open only if there's a validation error. On success the modal closes, and the new subject appears in the subject list.

If the subject still does not appear, check the Network tab for the POST request and ensure it includes an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header and returns 200/201.

## 🔎 Manual verification checklist — Dashboard flows

Use this checklist to verify forms, modals and API integrations across dashboards.

1. Admin (Admin Dashboard / Admin Subjects / Admin Users)

   - Log in as an admin and confirm `localStorage.tutorlink_user` includes a `token`.
   - Create a new subject (Admin Dashboard and Admin Subjects) using commas/semicolons/newlines; verify POST /api/v1/subjects returns 201 and subject appears.
   - Create a new user (Admin Users): verify POST /api/v1/admin/users returns 201 and user appears in list.
   - Update and delete users/subjects and confirm appropriate PUT/DELETE requests return 200 and UI updates.

2. Student Dashboard / Task Management

   - Create a task (Quick Add from Student Dashboard and Task Management): verify POST /api/v1/tasks returns 201 and task appears in tasks list.
   - Update task status and confirm PUT /api/v1/tasks/:id returns 200 and UI updates.

3. Tutor Dashboard / Availability

   - Update availability and confirm PUT /api/v1/tutors/profile returns 200 and availability shown to students.
   - Complete/cancel sessions and ensure the corresponding PUT endpoints return 200 and UI updates.

4. Booking flows

   - Book a session from the booking page and confirm POST /api/v1/sessions returns 201, user is redirected to their sessions page, and session appears.

5. Profile & Authentication

   - Update profile (Profile page) — PUT /api/v1/users/profile returns updated user and UI reflects changes.
   - Login/Logout flows: token is persisted in `tutorlink_user` and Authorization header appears on protected calls.

6. Study Planner
   - Generate a study plan (Study Planner / Task Management) — ensure POST or AI flow returns plan and it appears in the UI.

If any step returns 401 or no token is present, first re-login and check browser console/network. If you hit any non-2xx errors, capture the request/response and I can help debug further.
